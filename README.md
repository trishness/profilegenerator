# profilegenerator

This assignment dynamically creates a team page for a group of employees. Upon running the code in node, the user is prompted as to whether they would like to add a new employee profile. If they confirm that they would like to, they will then be prompted with several general questions that pertain to every type of employee. At the end of this secondary prompting of questions, the user will be asked a question specific to the role that they entered for the employee. Once the profile is finished, the employee will be added to a global array of employees and the user will be asked if they would like to add another employee, thus looping back over the entire process. If the user does not want to add an employee, each employee that they previously gave information about will be written to an html site that displays each team members stats. This assignment incorporated the use of TDD, a process that ensures that the code being written will be viable, functioning code. The assignment required two npms, jest and inquirer, as well as the use of Javascript, OOPs, node and html/CSS.
